For the Welcome Scene, we implement a FxRobot to check if the Start Game button works correctly and starts the game. Finally, we also check whether the background color of the screen is black.
For the Configuration Scene, the user needs to input his name and select the difficulty, the starting seed, and a season. Our tests check if the text field is taking the input correctly, if the combo boxes display the correct options and if your selection is registered. We also have tests for checking whether the Player's values are updated by implementing a FxRobot to hit the Continue button. Finally, we also check whether the background color of the screen is black.
For the Farm Scene, we first check if the money and the day are being displayed correctly. Then, we check whether the image of coins is next to the money of the player. Our tests also check if the plot contains 5 columns and 5 rows. Finally, we also check whether the background color of the screen is black.
