For M4, we created a test to check if the advanceDay button works, as day is incremented by 1.
We also created a check to ensure all plots are empty in farm scene once we just start a new game.
We checked if drop button works properly in InventoryScreen, in order to ensure item no longer remains
in inventory once dropped.
We made a test to ensure market is not empty once we start a new game, so that the player is able to
purchase any items at the start.
We also wrote a test to ensure market background color is set to black, in order to maintain
uniformity with the other scenes.
