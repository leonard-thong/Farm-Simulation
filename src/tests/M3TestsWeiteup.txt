For the FarmScene we implement a FxRobot, which we use to check if there is at least one crop on the plot. For the market, we check that the buy and the
sell functionality work. We also check that the player cannot buy more items if the inventory is full. Finally, we check that the nodes on the screen are
updated as needed.
